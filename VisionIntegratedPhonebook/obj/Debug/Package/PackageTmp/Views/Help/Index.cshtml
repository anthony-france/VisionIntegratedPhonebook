        <p>Facility Employees make up the largest bulk of the records used on this site.  Employee information should all be included and maintained on the AD account.  The company and department attributes are required for an employee to show up on the main page.  An office location is required for them to appear on the facilities detail pages.  A user without an office set will display on the main page but not on the facilies detail.</p>

        <div class="alert alert-info alert-dismissable"><p>With stratigic use of field settings, or lack of, you can have the facility display on the main page, while linking to another facility, and displaying as a contact for the facility.  For example, the TPK Warehouse, it is a seperate building and is displayed on the main page, however when you click on it the link directs you to the Tinly Park location.  This is because the users are currently considered as working in that facility and it is then displayed as a contact for Tinley Park.</p></div>
